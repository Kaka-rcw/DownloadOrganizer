#### Description:

DownloadOrganizer is a Python background script that automatically organizes your **Downloads** folder in real time. Whenever you download or move a file into your `Downloads` directory, the program detects it, determines its type, and relocates it into a category-specific subfolder such as `images`, `videos`, `pdf`, or `code`. This keeps your folder neat and structured without requiring manual sorting.

## Introduction  

For most people, the `Downloads` folder is one of the messiest places on their computer. Over time, it becomes filled with documents, pictures, videos, compressed archives, audio files, and random installers. Important files quickly get buried under piles of unrelated ones, making it frustrating to find what you need.  

DownloadOrganizer solves this problem by acting as a background organizer. Using Python’s `watchdog` library, it monitors your `Downloads` directory and automatically sorts files into meaningful subfolders the moment they appear. Think of it as a personal assistant that keeps your files tidy while you focus on more important tasks.  

This project is especially useful for students, developers, or professionals who download large numbers of files daily. Instead of wasting time dragging files into folders or leaving them cluttered, you can rely on DownloadOrganizer to handle the sorting for you.

## The Problem it Solves  
- **Cluttered Downloads**: A single folder with hundreds of files quickly becomes unmanageable.  
- **Duplicate filenames**: Operating systems add confusing suffixes like `(1)` or `(2)` to avoid overwriting, leading to messy naming.  
- **Lost files**: Without organization, it’s easy to lose track of where something went.  

Manually cleaning up works temporarily, but the mess always returns. DownloadOrganizer removes the need for manual sorting by:  
- Moving files instantly into categorized folders.  
- Handling duplicates gracefully with `_1`, `_2`, and so on.  
- Catching unknown file types in an `etc` folder so nothing is misplaced.  

The end result is a consistently clean and well-organized `Downloads` folder, without effort.

## How It Works  

The script operates in three main steps:  

1. **Monitoring with Watchdog**  
   - A `watchdog.Observer` tracks the `~/Downloads` folder.  
   - Whenever a file is created or moved, a custom event handler is triggered.  

2. **Categorization**  
   - Files are matched to categories using a `SUFFIX_MAP`.  
   - Examples:  
     - Images → `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpeg`  
     - Videos → `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`  
     - Audio → `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`  
     - Code → `.py`, `.cpp`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`  
     - PDFs → `.pdf`  
     - Everything else → `etc`  

3. **Relocation**  
   - Creates subfolders automatically if they don’t exist.  
   - Moves files safely with automatic renaming for duplicates.  
   - Runs continuously so the folder never becomes messy again.

## Design choices:

One of the main design considerations in this project was whether to use Python’s modern **`pathlib`** module or the traditional **`os`** module for handling file paths and operations. Both approaches are valid, but after testing and comparing, I chose to rely primarily on `pathlib` for the following reasons:  

1. **Readability and Simplicity**  
   - `pathlib` introduces an object-oriented approach to working with file paths. Instead of writing `os.path.join("Downloads", "images")`, you can simply write `Path("Downloads") / "images"`.  
   - This makes the code cleaner, more intuitive, and closer to how we think about file system paths.  

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   - File path syntax differs between Windows (`\`) and Unix-like systems (`/`).  
   - `pathlib` automatically handles these differences, ensuring the script works consistently across operating systems without needing manual adjustments.  

3. **Built-in Methods**  
   - `pathlib.Path` objects come with convenient methods like `.exists()`, `.mkdir()`, `.suffix`, `.stem`, and `.rename()`.  
   - These replace multiple `os` and `os.path` function calls, reducing boilerplate code.  

4. **Future-Proofing**  
   - While the `os` module is still widely used, `pathlib` is the recommended modern approach in the Python standard library.  
   - Choosing `pathlib` ensures the codebase is easier to maintain and aligns with current best practices.  

That said, `os` is not without merit. It can be slightly more familiar to beginners and sometimes provides lower-level control, especially when combined with `shutil` for file operations. In fact, DownloadOrganizer still imports `shutil` in some scenarios (e.g., moving files across different drives).  

Ultimately, I chose **`pathlib` as the primary tool** because it offers:  
- Cleaner code,  
- Reduced risk of platform-specific bugs, and  
- A more Pythonic design.
